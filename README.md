# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Null and Undefined Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to handling null and undefined values. The bug lies in how the `foo` function handles these values, which could lead to unexpected results. 

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers.  However, it only explicitly checks for null values and returns null if either of the input arguments is null. It fails to handle the case where one or both arguments might be undefined.  This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior when calling the function with undefined values.  Undefined values will not be caught and a `TypeError` will be thrown by the addition operator.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for both `null` and `undefined` values and handling them appropriately.  This ensures that the function behaves correctly regardless of whether null or undefined values are passed as arguments.  A more robust implementation might throw an error, return a default value, or use a more sophisticated type checking mechanism. 

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and see how the `foo` function is implemented with the bug.
3. Run `bug.js` and observe the output.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` and see how the `foo` function is implemented with the solution. 
5. Run `bugSolution.js` and observe the correct output.
